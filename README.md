Around The U.S.

This project portrays a user profile page. Some functionality includes:

-Editing the profile name and description.
-Adding or removing images
-The page elements' size changes to match the display
-Form validation on both the edit profile form and new image form.
-Single image viewing popup.

For this project to work I've used various techniques to make the
user's experience smooth. Within this project I used a responsive
design to match the user's display. Event driven functionality to
manage the popup windows and form submition. I've utilized
propagation handling techniques to prevent bubbling. These are
just some of the knowledge used to make this project.
